# Recommendation_System
A comparative study of Recommendation Systems

Three different Recommendation Systems are built and evaluated
Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Filtering 
Hybrid Recommendation System

Collaborative Filtering, particularly using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), excels at capturing user preferences by analyzing patterns in user-item interactions. It effectively tailors recommendations to individual tastes by using the user base collection. However, it struggles with the cold-start problem, where new users or items have insufficient interaction data, and it can be resource-intensive, especially in large-scale systems.

On the other hand, Content-Based Filtering, using methods like TF-IDF, is well-suited to handling the cold-start problem and is scalable across different domains. It recommends items based on their attributes and how they align with a user's past interactions. While effective, this method can sometimes over-specialize, leading to less diverse recommendations that are too similar to what the user has already seen.

A Hybrid Recommendation System combines the strengths of both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering. By integrating these approaches, it offers more personalized, accurate, and diverse recommendations, balancing the depth of collaborative filtering with the adaptability of content-based methods. While hybrid systems generally outperform individual methods, they are also more complex to implement, requiring careful integration and tuning to achieve the best results.
